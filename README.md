# Graphs

Hello, Thank you for showing interest.<br />
This is one of the assignments I developed while studying graphs in Algorithms and Data Structures course.

Major learning objectives were - <br />
-> Algorithm implementation from scratch<br />
-> Breadth first search<br />
-> Cycle detection<br />
-> Path length calculation from one point to another<br />
-> basic principles of graphing algorithms<br />

The class graph has the following operations available  - <br />

-> Graph();<br />
-> std::istream& operator >> (std::istream& in, Graph& graph);<br />
-> std::ostream& operator << (std::ostream& oStream, const Graph&);<br />
-> bool isConnected() const; <br />
-> bool hasCycle() const;<br />
-> void listComponents(std::ostream& oStream) const;<br />
-> Graph& operator = (const Graph&);<br />
-> Graph(const Graph&);<br />
-> ~Graph();<br />
-> int pathLength(int from, int to) const;<br />
